# Upgrade Guide: v1.0 → v2.0

## What's Changed

Version 2.0 adds **proactive memory recall** and several quality-of-life improvements. All changes are **backward compatible** - existing memories and configurations will continue to work.

## Quick Upgrade Steps

### 1. Backup Your Memories (Optional but Recommended)

If you have important memories stored, you can export them via Pinecone console or by listing all memories through the API before upgrading.

### 2. Pull Latest Code

```bash
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\mcp-smartmemory
git pull origin main
```

Or download the latest files and replace:
- `server.py`
- `memory_engine.py`

**Do NOT replace:**
- `config.py` (unchanged)
- `embeddings.py` (unchanged)
- `llm_client.py` (unchanged)
- `requirements.txt` (unchanged)

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (check system tray)
2. Relaunch Claude Desktop
3. Wait for MCP server to initialize

### 4. Verify Upgrade

In a new Claude conversation, check for:

1. **Resources visible**: Look for memory resources in the UI
2. **New tools available**: Ask Claude about the `auto_recall_memories` tool
3. **Test functionality**: Share a fact and ask Claude about it

### 5. No Configuration Changes Needed!

All improvements work with your existing settings. No need to modify:
- `claude_desktop_config.json`
- Environment variables
- API keys
- Pinecone index

## What You'll Notice

### Immediate Improvements

1. **Automatic Memory Recall**
   - Claude now recalls relevant memories proactively
   - You don't need to ask "check my memories first"
   - Context is automatically injected

2. **Better Memory Management**
   - Outdated memories get updated instead of rejected
   - Duplicate detection is smarter
   - Search results are more accurate

3. **Visible Recent Memories**
   - Claude can see your last 10 memories
   - Memory stats visible in resources
   - System instructions built-in

### Optional: Take Advantage of New Features

#### Consolidate Existing Memories

If you have many fragmented memories, run consolidation:

```
You: "Consolidate my memories"
Claude: [calls consolidate_memories tool]
Result: Fragmented memories merged into coherent summaries
```

#### Try Hybrid Search

Search is now automatically hybrid (semantic + keyword). You'll notice:
- Better exact name/term matching
- More relevant results for specific queries
- Improved precision overall

## Breaking Changes

**None!** This is a fully backward-compatible upgrade.

- Old tools still work the same way
- Existing memories are preserved
- Configuration format unchanged
- API contracts unchanged

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback for any reason:

### Option 1: Git Revert
```bash
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\mcp-smartmemory
git checkout v1.0  # or specific commit hash
```

### Option 2: Restore Files
Replace these files with v1.0 versions:
- `server.py`
- `memory_engine.py`

Then restart Claude Desktop.

**Note**: Memories stored with v2.0 will still work with v1.0 - no data loss.

## Troubleshooting

### Resources Not Showing Up

**Symptom**: Can't see `memory://recent` or other resources

**Fix**:
1. Verify Claude Desktop version supports MCP resources (2024.0+)
2. Check logs at `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp.log`
3. Ensure server started successfully (no errors in log)
4. Try completely restarting Claude Desktop

### Auto-Recall Not Working

**Symptom**: Claude not automatically recalling memories

**Fix**:
1. This is a behavioral change - Claude needs to learn the pattern
2. Try explicit prompt: "Use auto_recall_memories to check context first"
3. After a few uses, Claude will do this automatically
4. Check that `memory://system-prompt` resource is visible

### Memory Updates Not Happening

**Symptom**: Similar memories not updating old ones

**Fix**:
1. Verify similarity is between 0.85-0.94 (update zone)
2. Check logs for "Similar memory found, treating as update"
3. If too many duplicates rejected, lower `DEDUP_THRESHOLD` slightly

### Consolidation Fails

**Symptom**: Consolidation reports 0 groups

**Fix**:
1. Need at least 3 memories to consolidate
2. Need at least 2 similar memories (≥0.75 similarity)
3. Check LLM API is working (view logs)
4. Try consolidating specific tag with `tag="preference"`

## Performance Notes

### Resource Usage

v2.0 uses slightly more resources:

| Metric | v1.0 | v2.0 | Impact |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Memory | ~50MB | ~80MB | Low |
| API calls | Baseline | +1 per response | Low |
| Latency | Baseline | +200-500ms | Low |

The increased API call is for auto-recall embedding generation, which runs in parallel with Claude's thinking time, so user-perceived latency is minimal.

### Cost Impact

With Pinecone Inference API:
- **v1.0**: ~$0.0001 per memory operation
- **v2.0**: ~$0.0002 per conversation turn (includes auto-recall)
- **Monthly** (100 conversations): ~$0.02 increase

Negligible cost increase for significant UX improvement.

## New Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Let Claude extract automatically** - Don't preface with "remember this"
2. **Trust auto-recall** - Claude will retrieve context when needed
3. **Consolidate periodically** - Every 50+ memories, run consolidation
4. **Update memories naturally** - Just state new preferences; old ones will update

### For Developers

1. **Monitor logs** - New logging for updates and consolidation
2. **Tune thresholds** - Adjust update threshold (0.85) if needed
3. **Use resources** - Check `memory://stats` for capacity
4. **Leverage hybrid search** - Better for specific queries

## FAQ

### Q: Will my existing memories still work?
**A**: Yes! 100% compatible. No migration needed.

### Q: Do I need to reconfigure anything?
**A**: No. All settings remain the same.

### Q: Can I disable auto-recall?
**A**: Not directly, but you can instruct Claude to not use it. The feature is designed to be unobtrusive.

### Q: Will memories from v1.0 get updated by v2.0?
**A**: Yes! The update detection works on all memories, old and new.

### Q: Should I consolidate immediately after upgrading?
**A**: Only if you have 50+ memories. Otherwise wait until you reach capacity.

### Q: Can I mix v1.0 and v2.0 servers?
**A**: Technically yes (same Pinecone index), but not recommended. Choose one version.
