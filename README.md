## Attribution

This project's memory management system was derived from [gramanoid's Adaptive Memory filter for Open WebUI](https://github.com/gramanoid/owui-adaptive-memory). The original filter provided the foundation for LLM-based memory extraction, embedding similarity, and semantic deduplication. This implementation refactors those concepts into a standalone MCP server / REST API with simplified architecture for broader platform compatibility.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Pinecone account and API key
- OpenAI API key (or compatible LLM API)
- Claude Desktop for Windows

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download

Create the project directory and download all files:

```
C:\Users\YourUsername\mcp-smartmemory\
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt in the project directory:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\mcp-smartmemory
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop config file:

**Windows Location:**
```
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add the SmartMemory server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smartmemory": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\mcp-smartmemory\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\mcp-smartmemory\\server.py"],
      "env": {
        "PINECONE_API_KEY": "your-pinecone-api-key",
        "PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT": "us-east-1-aws",
        "PINECONE_INDEX_NAME": "adaptive-memory",
        "LLM_API_URL": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
        "LLM_API_KEY": "your-openai-api-key",
        "LLM_MODEL": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "EMBEDDING_PROVIDER": "pinecone",
        "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "llama-text-embed-v2",
        "MAX_MEMORIES": "200",
        "DEDUP_THRESHOLD": "0.95",
        "MIN_CONFIDENCE": "0.5",
        "RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD": "0.6"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Use double backslashes (`\\`) in Windows paths in JSON.

### 4. (Optional) Create .env File for Manual Testing

If you want to test the server manually (not through Claude Desktop), create a `.env` file in the project directory:

```
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1-aws
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=smartmemory
LLM_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
LLM_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=pinecone
EMBEDDING_MODEL=llama-text-embed-v2
MAX_MEMORIES=200
DEDUP_THRESHOLD=0.95
MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.5
RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=0.6
```

**Note:** This is only needed for `python server.py` testing. Claude Desktop passes these values from the JSON config.

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop for the MCP server to load.

## Usage

The server provides **8 tools** and **3 resources** that Claude can use:

### MCP Resources (Auto-Visible)

Claude sees these automatically without calling tools:

- **`memory://recent`** - Last 10 stored memories with tags
- **`memory://stats`** - System statistics and capacity
- **`memory://system-prompt`** - Usage instructions for Claude

### Tools

### 1. Auto-Recall Memories (NEW!)

Automatically retrieves relevant memories for current conversation:

```
Claude internally calls this at response start:
auto_recall_memories(conversation_context="user asking about pets")
→ Returns relevant memories about user's pets
```

**Parameters:**
- `conversation_context`: Brief topic summary
- `limit`: Max memories to return (default: 5)
- `user_id`: User filter (optional)

### 2. Extract Memories

Automatically extracts and stores memories from conversation:

```
User: "I just adopted a cat named Whiskers"
Claude uses extract_memories tool in background
→ Stores: "User has a cat named Whiskers"
```

**Optional Parameters:**
- `user_id`: Associate memory with specific user
- `agent_id`: Track which agent created the memory
- `run_id`: Link memory to conversation session

### 3. Search Memories

Search for specific memories with hybrid semantic + keyword matching:

```
User: "What do you know about my pets?"
Claude uses search_memories with query="pets"
→ Returns relevant memories (now with keyword boost!)
```

**Parameters:**
- `query`: Search query
- `limit`: Max results (default: 5)
- `user_id`: Filter by user (optional)
- `agent_id`: Filter by agent (optional)
- `categories`: Filter by tags (optional)

**Improvement**: Now uses hybrid search for better precision!

### 4. Get Relevant Memories

Retrieves contextually relevant memories above relevance threshold:

```
User: "Tell me about my hobbies"
Claude uses get_relevant_memories
→ Returns hobby-related memories above threshold
```

**Parameters:**
- `current_message`: Message to find context for
- `limit`: Max results (default: 5)
- `user_id`: Filter by user (optional)

### 5. Consolidate Memories (NEW!)

Merge fragmented related memories into coherent summaries:

```
Before: ["User has a cat", "Cat is named Whiskers", "Cat is orange"]
After: ["User has an orange cat named Whiskers"]
```

**Parameters:**
- `user_id`: User to consolidate for (optional)
- `tag`: Specific category to consolidate (optional)

Use this periodically to improve memory quality and reduce redundancy.

### 6. Delete Memory

Remove a specific memory by ID:

```
User: "Delete that memory about my cat"
Claude uses delete_memory with memory_id
→ Removes the memory
```

### 7. Batch Delete Memories

Delete multiple memories at once:

```
Claude uses batch_delete_memories with memory_ids=["mem_123", "mem_456"]
→ Deletes both memories efficiently
```

### 8. Get Stats

View memory system statistics:

```
Claude uses get_stats
→ Returns: Total memories, embedding dimension, max capacity
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### 🗣️ Everyday Conversations

**Before SmartMemory v2.0:**
```
User: "I love Python programming and work as a developer in Seattle."
Claude: "That's great! Python is a wonderful language."

User (next day): "What programming languages do I like?"
Claude: "I don't have that information about your preferences." ❌
```

**After SmartMemory v2.0:**
```
User: "I love Python programming and work as a developer in Seattle."
Claude: [auto-extracts memory] "That's great! I've noted your preference for Python and your role as a developer in Seattle."

User (next day): "What programming languages do I like?"
Claude: [auto-recalls memories] "Based on our conversations, you love Python programming!" ✅
```

### 🎯 Memory Consolidation in Action

```
User: "Consolidate my memories about work"
Claude: [calls consolidate_memories]
Before: 
- "User is a developer"
- "User codes in Python" 
- "User works in Seattle"
- "User prefers remote work"

After:
- "User is a Python developer in Seattle who prefers remote work"
```

### 🔍 Hybrid Search Benefits

```
User: "What did I say about my cat named Whiskers?"
Claude: [uses hybrid search]
→ Finds exact name match "Whiskers" + semantic context about pets
→ Better results than semantic search alone!
```
